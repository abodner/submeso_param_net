# submeso_param_net
Repo to train a Neural Network parmeterization for submesoscale vertical buoyancy fluxes (Bodner, Balwada, and Zanna, to be submitted to JAMES)

This is the code repository for Bodner, Balwada, and Zanna. A Data-Driven Approach for Parameterizing Ocean Submesoscale  Buoyancy Fluxes (in prep).

Plotting scripts are in the folder python/plotting_scripts.

Code for processing the LLC4320 to generate training data is in ****.
